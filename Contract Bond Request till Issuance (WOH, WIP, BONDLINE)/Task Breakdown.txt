--------------
1. Aggregate Rating : UI / Database / Business Logic
2. Grouping Bond with the Bondline in the Offer (Progress Bar)
3. Offer Summary
4. Merging Bond issuance flow (Contract Bond Only, BondLine Only, Bond with the BondLine)
of those 4, probably only (4) the bond issuance.
5) Maintenance / Account's Bond Line Page
6) Accept Decline quote probably needs the Offer Summary
7) Client's View of the Bond Line. (1 for Bond Offers)
8) Sub-Broker's View of the Bond Line. (1 for Bond Offers)
Sub-Lite has no Fee just commission

2 and 4 should probably be done after everything else
but it also means I don't care about the issuance page
somebody could work on it in parallel if they wanted
1 > 5,7,8 > 3,6 > 4 > 2
I think 1 can be parallel to 5,7,8
but 7,8 cause work overlap / merge conflicts
5 will not cause overlap
or should not
